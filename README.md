DOM EVENTS WITH JAVASCRIPT
Mouse Events
When you use a mouse device on a website, mouse events fire. You’ve seen the click and wheel events, but, there are even more mouse events to explore!

The mousedown event is fired when the user presses a mouse button down. This is different from a click event because mousedown doesn’t need the mouse button to be released to fire.

The mouseup event is fired when the user releases the mouse button. This is different from the click and mousedown events because mouseup doesn’t depend on the mouse button being pressed down to fire.
